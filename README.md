> **36,405 unique n8n workflows** — curated community templates + AI-generated synthetic workflows, all deduplicated and labeled for semantic search and ML training.

## 🆕 What's New: Synthetic Dataset Generation

We've scaled this repository from 3,800 to **36,405 unique workflows** using a **Combinatorial Archetype Engine**:

| Source | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Repository Curated** | 3,831 | Hand-picked community templates |
| **Synthetic Generated** | 12,500+ | Archetype-based combinatorial expansion |
| **External Community** | 23,900+ | Cleaned HuggingFace dataset |
| **Final (Deduplicated)** | **36,405** | Unique, ML-ready workflows |

### How It Works

Instead of random generation (which produces broken JSON), we use **5 proven archetype blueprints**:

| Archetype | Flow |
|-----------|------|
| **AI Pipeline** | Trigger → AI Analysis → Database → Notification |
| **Cross-PM Sync** | Schedule → Source PM → Destination PM (Jira↔Asana↔Trello) |
| **Redundant Backup** | Trigger → SQL Database → NoSQL Backup |
| **Support Triage** | Form → AI Classification → Ticket → Team Notification |
| **E-commerce** | Order Trigger → CRM Update → Email Receipt |

Each archetype uses **equivalency groups** (Postgres = MySQL = Supabase) and generates every valid combination:

```
27 triggers × 4 AI models × 13 databases × 5 messaging = 7,020 workflows
```

## 📦 Dataset Downloads

Large data files are available as **GitHub Release assets**:

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `n8n_workflows.jsonl` | ~280MB | Final consolidated dataset (36,405 workflows) |
| `n8n_full.parquet` | ~118MB | Same data in Parquet format |

## 💖 Support the Atlas

Keeping a living automation library online (and refreshing all upstream sources) takes time. If these workflows save you cycles, please consider:

- [**Sponsoring on GitHub**](https://github.com/sponsors/Ker102) to fund future packs and hosting.
- [**Starring the repository**](https://github.com/Ker102/n8n-ai-automation-workflow-atlas) so more builders discover it.
- Sharing the repo/link on socials or inside your team's automation channel.

## 🧰 Dataset Generation Scripts

Generate your own synthetic workflows or process external datasets:

```bash
# Generate synthetic workflows (12,500+)
node scripts/generate-synthetic-workflows.mjs

# Convert external parquet dataset
node scripts/convert-parquet.js

# Clean and validate external data
node scripts/clean-external-data.mjs

# Consolidate all sources with deduplication
node scripts/prepare-dataset.mjs

# Add semantic labels for ML
node scripts/final-labeling.mjs
```

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `generate-synthetic-workflows.mjs` | Combinatorial archetype engine |
| `convert-parquet.js` | Convert HuggingFace parquet to JSONL |
| `clean-external-data.mjs` | Filter invalid workflows, extract metadata |
| `prepare-dataset.mjs` | Merge sources, deduplicate |
| `final-labeling.mjs` | Add semantic labels for vector search |
| `analyze-node-coverage.mjs` | Audit node type usage |

## 🛠️ Import Any Workflow Into n8n

1. **Clone or download** this repo so you have the `workflows/` directory locally.
2. In your n8n instance, click **Import > From File** (or paste JSON on an open canvas).
3. **Select a workflow** from the folder that matches the capability you need.
4. n8n will load the nodes; **review credentials** placeholders (OpenAI, Pinecone, Box, etc.).
5. **Create or link credentials** inside n8n to match the workflow's requirements.
6. Hit **Activate** on the workflow, test with sample data, then customize nodes to fit your stack.
